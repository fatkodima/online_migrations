# OnlineMigrations

Catch unsafe PostgreSQL migrations in development and run them easier in production.

:white_check_mark: Detects potentially dangerous operations\
:white_check_mark: Prevents them from running by default\
:white_check_mark: Provides instructions and helpers on safer ways to do what you want

**Note**: You probably don't need this gem for smaller projects, as operations that are unsafe at scale can be perfectly safe on smaller, low-traffic tables.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Cool, but there is a `strong_migrations` already

See [comparison to `strong_migrations`](#comparison-to-strong_migrations)

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7+
- Rails 6.1+
- PostgreSQL 9.6+

For older Ruby and Rails versions you can use '< 0.11' version of this gem.

**Note**: Since some migration helpers use database `VIEW`s to implement their logic, it is recommended to use `structure.sql` schema format, or otherwise add some gem (like [scenic](https://github.com/scenic-views/scenic)) to be able to dump them into the `schema.rb`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'online_migrations'
```

And then run:

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bin/rails generate online_migrations:install
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

**Note**: If you do not have plans on using [background data migrations](docs/background_data_migrations.md) or [background schema migrations](docs/background_schema_migrations.md) features, then you can delete the generated migration and regenerate it later, if needed.

### Upgrading

If you're already using [background data migrations](docs/background_data_migrations.md) or [background schema migrations](docs/background_schema_migrations.md), your background migrations tables may require additional columns. After every upgrade run:

```sh
$ bin/rails generate online_migrations:upgrade
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Motivation

Writing a safe migration can be daunting. Numerous articles have been written on the topic and a few gems are trying to address the problem. Even for someone who has a pretty good command of PostgreSQL, remembering all the subtleties of explicit locking can be problematic.

**Online Migrations** was created to catch dangerous operations and provide a guidance and code helpers to run them safely.

An operation is classified as dangerous if it either:

- Blocks reads or writes for more than a few seconds (after a lock is acquired)
- Has a good chance of causing application errors

## Example

Consider the following migration:

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false, null: false
  end
end
```

If the `users` table is large, running this migration on a live PostgreSQL < 11 database will likely cause downtime.

A safer approach would be to run something like the following:

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  # Do not wrap the migration in a transaction so that locks are held for a shorter time.
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def up
    # Lower PostgreSQL's lock timeout to avoid statement queueing.
    execute "SET lock_timeout TO '5s'" # The lock_timeout duration is customizable.

    # Add the column without the default value and the not-null constraint.
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean

    # Set the column's default value.
    change_column_default :users, :admin, false

    # Backfill the column in batches.
    User.in_batches.update_all(admin: false)

    # Add the not-null constraint. Beforehand, set a short statement timeout so that
    # Postgres does not spend too much time performing the full table scan to verify
    # the column contains no nulls.
    execute "SET statement_timeout TO '5s'"
    change_column_null :users, :admin, false
  end

  def down
    remove_column :users, :admin
  end
end
```

When you actually run the original migration, you will get an error message:

```txt
⚠️  [online_migrations] Dangerous operation detected ⚠️

Adding a column with a non-null default blocks reads and writes while the entire table is rewritten.

A safer approach is to:
1. add the column without a default value
2. change the column default
3. backfill existing rows with the new value
4. add the NOT NULL constraint

add_column_with_default takes care of all this steps:

class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_column_with_default :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false, null: false
  end
end
```

It suggests how to safely implement a migration, which essentially runs the steps similar to described in the previous example.

### Removing a column

:x: **Bad**

Active Record caches database columns at runtime, so if you drop a column, it can cause exceptions until your app reboots.

```ruby
class RemoveNameFromUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    remove_column :users, :name
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

1. Ignore the column:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     self.ignored_columns += ["name"]
   end
   ```

2. Deploy
3. Wrap column removing in a `safety_assured` block:

   ```ruby
   class RemoveNameFromUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       safety_assured { remove_column :users, :name }
     end
   end
   ```

4. Remove column ignoring from step 1
5. Deploy

### Adding a column with a default value

:x: **Bad**

In earlier versions of PostgreSQL adding a column with a non-null default value to an existing table blocks reads and writes while the entire table is rewritten.

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```

In PostgreSQL 11+ this no longer requires a table rewrite and is safe. Volatile expressions, however, such as `random()`, will still result in table rewrites.

:white_check_mark: **Good**

A safer approach is to:

1. add the column without a default value
2. change the column default
3. backfill existing rows with the new value

`add_column_with_default` helper takes care of all this steps:

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_column_with_default :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.

### Backfilling data

:x: **Bad**

Active Record wraps each migration in a transaction, and backfilling in the same transaction that alters a table keeps the table locked for the [duration of the backfill](https://wework.github.io/data/2015/11/05/add-columns-with-default-values-to-large-tables-in-rails-postgres/).

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean
    User.update_all(admin: false)
  end
end
```

Also, running a single query to update data can cause issues for large tables.

:white_check_mark: **Good**

There are three keys to backfilling safely: batching, throttling, and running it outside a transaction. Use a `update_column_in_batches` helper in a separate migration with `disable_ddl_transaction!`.

```ruby
class AddAdminToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :admin, :boolean
  end
end

class BackfillUsersAdminColumn < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def up
    update_column_in_batches(:users, :admin, false, pause_ms: 10)
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.
**Note**: You may consider [background data migrations](#background-data-migrations) or [background schema migrations](#background-schema-migrations) to run data changes on large tables.

### Changing the type of a column

:x: **Bad**

Changing the type of an existing column blocks reads and writes while the entire table is rewritten.

```ruby
class ChangeFilesSizeType < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    change_column :files, :size, :bigint
  end
end
```

A few changes don't require a table rewrite (and are safe) in PostgreSQL:

Type | Safe Changes
--- | ---
`bit` | Changing to `bit_varying`
`bit_varying` | Increasing or removing `:limit`
`cidr` | Changing to `inet`
`citext` | Changing to `text` if not indexed, changing to `string` with no `:limit` if not indexed
`datetime` | Increasing or removing `:precision`, changing to `timestamptz` when session time zone is UTC in PostgreSQL 12+
`decimal` | Increasing `:precision` at same `:scale`, removing `:precision` and `:scale`
`interval` | Increasing or removing `:precision`
`numeric` | Increasing `:precision` at same `:scale`, removing `:precision` and `:scale`
`string` | Increasing or removing `:limit`, changing to `text`, changing to `citext` if not indexed
`text` | Changing to `string` with no `:limit`, changing to `citext` if not indexed
`timestamptz` | Increasing or removing `:limit`, changing to `datetime` when session time zone is UTC in PostgreSQL 12+
`xml` | Changing to `text`, changing to `string` with no `:limit`

:white_check_mark: **Good**

#### "Classic" approach (abstract)

1. Create a new column
2. Write to both columns
3. Backfill data from the old column to the new column
4. Move reads from the old column to the new column
5. Stop writing to the old column
6. Drop the old column

#### :bullettrain_side: Concrete steps for Active Record

**Note**: The following steps can also be used to change the primary key's type (e.g., from `integer` to `bigint`).

A safer approach can be accomplished in several steps:

1. Create a new column and keep column's data in sync:

   ```ruby
   class InitializeChangeFilesSizeType < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       initialize_column_type_change :files, :size, :bigint
     end
   end
   ```

   **Note**: `initialize_column_type_change` accepts additional options (like `:limit`, `:default` etc)
   which will be passed to `add_column` when creating a new column, so you can override previous values.

2. Backfill data from the old column to the new column:

   ```ruby
   class BackfillChangeFilesSizeType < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     disable_ddl_transaction!

     def up
       # You can use `backfill_column_for_type_change_in_background` if want to
       # backfill using background migrations.
       backfill_column_for_type_change :files, :size
     end

     def down
       # no op
     end
   end
   ```

3. Make sure your application works with values in both formats (when read from the database, converting
during writes works automatically). For most column type changes, this does not need any updates in the app.
4. Deploy
5. Copy indexes, foreign keys, check constraints, NOT NULL constraint, swap new column in place:

   ```ruby
   class FinalizeChangeFilesSizeType < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     disable_ddl_transaction!

     def change
       finalize_column_type_change :files, :size
     end
   end
   ```

6. Deploy
7. Finally, if everything works as expected, remove copy trigger and old column:

   ```ruby
   class CleanupChangeFilesSizeType < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def up
       cleanup_column_type_change :files, :size
     end

     def down
       initialize_column_type_change :files, :size, :integer
     end
   end
   ```

8. Remove changes from step 3, if any
9. Deploy

### Renaming a column

:x: **Bad**

Renaming a column that's in use will cause errors in your application.

```ruby
class RenameUsersNameToFirstName < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    rename_column :users, :name, :first_name
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

#### "Classic" approach (abstract)

1. Create a new column
2. Write to both columns
3. Backfill data from the old column to the new column
4. Move reads from the old column to the new column
5. Stop writing to the old column
6. Drop the old column

#### :bullettrain_side: Enhanced approach (with concrete steps for Active Record)

The "classic" approach suggests creating a new column and copy data/indexes/etc to it from the old column. This can be costly for very large tables. There is a trick that helps to avoid such heavy operations.

The technique is built on top of database views, using the following steps:

1. Rename the table to some temporary name
2. Create a VIEW using the old table name with addition of a new column as an alias of the old one
3. Add a workaround for Active Record's schema cache

For the previous example, to rename `name` column to `first_name` of the `users` table, we can run:

```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE users RENAME TO users_column_rename;
CREATE VIEW users AS SELECT *, first_name AS name FROM users_column_rename;
COMMIT;
```

As database views do not expose the underlying table schema (default values, not null constraints, indexes, etc), further steps are needed to update the application to use the new table name. Active Record heavily relies on this data, for example, to initialize new models.

To work around this limitation, we need to tell Active Record to acquire this information from original table using the new table name.

**Online Migrations** provides several helpers to implement column renaming:

1. Instruct Rails that you are going to rename a column:

   ```ruby
   OnlineMigrations.config.column_renames = {
     "users" => {
       "name" => "first_name"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Note**: You also need to temporarily enable partial writes (is disabled by default in Active Record >= 7)
   until the process of column rename is fully done.

   ```ruby
   # config/application.rb
   # For Active Record >= 7
   config.active_record.partial_inserts = true

   # Or for Active Record < 7
   config.active_record.partial_writes = true
   ```

2. Deploy
3. Tell the database that you are going to rename a column. This will not actually rename any columns,
nor any data/indexes/foreign keys copying will be made, so will be instantaneous.
It will use a combination of a VIEW and column aliasing to work with both column names simultaneously

   ```ruby
   class InitializeRenameUsersNameToFirstName < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       initialize_column_rename :users, :name, :first_name
     end
   end
   ```

4. Replace usages of the old column with a new column in the codebase
5. If you enabled Active Record `enumerate_columns_in_select_statements` setting in your application
   (is disabled by default in Active Record >= 7), then you need to ignore old column:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     self.ignored_columns += ["name"]
   end
   ```

6. Deploy
7. Remove the column rename config from step 1
8. Remove the column ignore from step 5, if added
9. Remove the VIEW created in step 3 and finally rename the column:

   ```ruby
   class FinalizeRenameUsersNameToFirstName < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       finalize_column_rename :users, :name, :first_name
     end
   end
   ```

10. Deploy

### Renaming a table

:x: **Bad**

Renaming a table that's in use will cause errors in your application.

```ruby
class RenameClientsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    rename_table :clients, :users
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

#### "Classic" approach (abstract)

1. Create a new table
2. Write to both tables
3. Backfill data from the old table to new table
4. Move reads from the old table to the new table
5. Stop writing to the old table
6. Drop the old table

#### :bullettrain_side: Enhanced approach (with concrete steps for Active Record)

The "classic" approach suggests creating a new table and copy data/indexes/etc to it from the old table. This can be costly for very large tables. There is a trick that helps to avoid such heavy operations.

The technique is built on top of database views, using the following steps:

1. Rename the database table
2. Create a VIEW using the old table name by pointing to the new table name
3. Add a workaround for Active Record's schema cache

For the previous example, to rename `clients` table to `users`, we can run:

```sql
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE clients RENAME TO users;
CREATE VIEW clients AS SELECT * FROM users;
COMMIT;
```

As database views do not expose the underlying table schema (default values, not null constraints, indexes, etc), further steps are needed to update the application to use the new table name. Active Record heavily relies on this data, for example, to initialize new models.

To work around this limitation, we need to tell Active Record to acquire this information from original table using the new table name.

**Online Migrations** provides several helpers to implement table renaming:

1. Instruct Rails that you are going to rename a table:

   ```ruby
   OnlineMigrations.config.table_renames = {
     "clients" => "users"
   }
   ```

2. Deploy
3. Create a VIEW:

   ```ruby
   class InitializeRenameClientsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       initialize_table_rename :clients, :users
     end
   end
   ```

4. Replace usages of the old table with a new table in the codebase
5. Remove the table rename config from step 1
6. Deploy
7. Remove the VIEW created in step 3:

   ```ruby
   class FinalizeRenameClientsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
     def change
       finalize_table_rename :clients, :users
     end
   end
   ```

8. Deploy

### Creating a table with the force option

:x: **Bad**

The `force` option can drop an existing table.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, force: true do |t|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Create tables without the `force` option.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

If you intend to drop an existing table, run `drop_table` first.

### Adding a check constraint

:x: **Bad**

Adding a check constraint blocks reads and writes while every row is checked.

```ruby
class AddCheckConstraint < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_check_constraint :users, "char_length(name) >= 1", name: "name_check"
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add the check constraint without validating existing rows, and then validate them in a separate transaction:

```ruby
class AddCheckConstraint < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_check_constraint :users, "char_length(name) >= 1", name: "name_check", validate: false
    validate_check_constraint :users, name: "name_check"
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.

### Setting NOT NULL on an existing column

:x: **Bad**

Setting `NOT NULL` on an existing column blocks reads and writes while every row is checked.

```ruby
class ChangeUsersNameNull < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    change_column_null :users, :name, false
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Instead, add a check constraint and validate it in a separate transaction:

```ruby
class ChangeUsersNameNull < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_not_null_constraint :users, :name, name: "users_name_null", validate: false
    validate_not_null_constraint :users, :name, name: "users_name_null"
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.

A `NOT NULL` check constraint is functionally equivalent to setting `NOT NULL` on the column (but it won't show up in `schema.rb` in Rails < 6.1). In PostgreSQL 12+, once the check constraint is validated, you can safely set `NOT NULL` on the column and drop the check constraint.

```ruby
class ChangeUsersNameNullDropCheck < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    # in PostgreSQL 12+, you can then safely set NOT NULL on the column
    change_column_null :users, :name, false
    remove_check_constraint :users, name: "users_name_null"
  end
end
```

### Executing SQL directly

Online Migrations does not support inspecting what happens inside an `execute` call, so cannot help you here. Make really sure that what you're doing is safe before proceeding, then wrap it in a `safety_assured { ... }` block:

```ruby
class ExecuteSQL < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    safety_assured { execute "..." }
  end
end
```

### Adding an index non-concurrently

:x: **Bad**

Adding an index non-concurrently blocks writes.

```ruby
class AddIndexOnUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_index :users, :email, unique: true
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add indexes concurrently.

```ruby
class AddIndexOnUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :users, :email, unique: true, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail. Also, note that indexes on new tables (those created in the same migration) don't require this.

### Removing an index non-concurrently

:x: **Bad**

While actual removing of an index is usually fast, removing it non-concurrently tries to obtain an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table, waiting for all existing queries to complete and blocking all the subsequent queries (even `SELECT`s) on that table until the lock is obtained and index is removed.

```ruby
class RemoveIndexOnUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    remove_index :users, :email
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Remove indexes concurrently.

```ruby
class RemoveIndexOnUsersEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    remove_index :users, :email, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.

### Replacing an index

:x: **Bad**

Removing an old index before replacing it with the new one might result in slow queries while building the new index.

```ruby
class AddIndexOnCreationToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    remove_index :projects, :creator_id, algorithm: :concurrently
    add_index :projects, [:creator_id, :created_at], algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

**Note**: If removed index is covered by any existing index, then it is safe to remove the index before replacing it with the new one.

:white_check_mark: **Good**

A safer approach is to create the new index and then delete the old one.

```ruby
class AddIndexOnCreationToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :projects, [:creator_id, :created_at], algorithm: :concurrently
    remove_index :projects, :creator_id, algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

### Adding a reference

:x: **Bad**

Rails adds an index non-concurrently to references by default, which blocks writes. Additionally, if `foreign_key` option (without `validate: false`) is provided, both tables are blocked while it is validated.

```ruby
class AddUserToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_reference :projects, :user, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Make sure the index is added concurrently and the foreign key is added in a separate migration.
Or you can use `add_reference_concurrently` helper. It will create a reference and take care of safely adding index and/or foreign key.

```ruby
class AddUserToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_reference_concurrently :projects, :user
  end
end
```

**Note**: If you forget `disable_ddl_transaction!`, the migration will fail.

### Adding a foreign key

:x: **Bad**

Adding a foreign key blocks writes on both tables.

```ruby
class AddForeignKeyToProjectsUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_foreign_key :projects, :users
  end
end
```

or

```ruby
class AddReferenceToProjectsUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_reference :projects, :user, foreign_key: true
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add the foreign key without validating existing rows:

```ruby
class AddForeignKeyToProjectsUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_foreign_key :projects, :users, validate: false
  end
end
```

Then validate them in a separate migration:

```ruby
class ValidateForeignKeyOnProjectsUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    validate_foreign_key :projects, :users
  end
end
```

### Adding an exclusion constraint

:x: **Bad**

Adding an exclusion constraint blocks reads and writes while every row is checked.

```ruby
class AddExclusionContraint < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_exclusion_constraint :users, "number WITH =", using: :gist
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

[Let us know](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/issues/new) if you have a safe way to do this (exclusion constraints cannot be marked `NOT VALID`).

### Adding a unique constraint

:x: **Bad**

Adding a unique constraint blocks reads and writes while the underlying index is being built.

```ruby
class AddUniqueConstraint < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_unique_constraint :sections, :position, deferrable: :deferred
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

A safer approach is to create a unique index first, and then create a unique key using that index.

```ruby
class AddUniqueConstraintAddIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :sections, :position, unique: true, name: "index_sections_on_position", algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

```ruby
class AddUniqueConstraint < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def up
    add_unique_constraint :sections, :position, deferrable: :deferred, using_index: "index_sections_on_position"
  end

  def down
    remove_unique_constraint :sections, :position
  end
end
```

### Adding a json column

:x: **Bad**

There's no equality operator for the `json` column type, which can cause errors for existing `SELECT DISTINCT` queries in your application.

```ruby
class AddSettingsToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :projects, :settings, :json
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Use `jsonb` instead.

```ruby
class AddSettingsToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :projects, :settings, :jsonb
  end
end
```

### Adding a stored generated column

:x: **Bad**

Adding a stored generated column causes the entire table to be rewritten. During this time, reads and writes are blocked.

```ruby
class AddLowerEmailToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :lower_email, :virtual, type: :string, as: "LOWER(email)", stored: true
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add a non-generated column and use callbacks or triggers instead.

### Using primary key with short integer type

:x: **Bad**

When using short integer types as primary key types, [there is a risk](https://m.signalvnoise.com/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-922am-cst/) of running out of IDs on inserts. The default type in Active Record < 5.1 for primary and foreign keys is `INTEGER`, which allows a little over of 2 billion records. Active Record 5.1 changed the default type to `BIGINT`.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, id: :integer do |t|
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Use one of `bigint`, `bigserial`, `uuid` instead.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, id: :bigint do |t| # bigint is the default for Active Record >= 5.1
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

### Hash indexes

:x: **Bad - PostgreSQL < 10**

Hash index operations are not WAL-logged, so hash indexes might need to be rebuilt with `REINDEX` after a database crash if there were unwritten changes. Also, changes to hash indexes are not replicated over streaming or file-based replication after the initial base backup, so they give wrong answers to queries that subsequently use them. For these reasons, hash index use is discouraged.

```ruby
class AddIndexToUsersOnEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_index :users, :email, unique: true, using: :hash
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good - PostgreSQL < 10**

Use B-tree indexes instead.

```ruby
class AddIndexToUsersOnEmail < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_index :users, :email, unique: true # B-tree by default
  end
end
```

### Adding multiple foreign keys

:x: **Bad**

Adding multiple foreign keys in a single migration blocks writes on all involved tables until migration is completed.
Avoid adding foreign key more than once per migration file, unless the source and target tables are identical.

```ruby
class CreateUserProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :user_projects do |t|
      t.belongs_to :user, foreign_key: true
      t.belongs_to :project, foreign_key: true
    end
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add additional foreign keys in separate migration files. See [adding a foreign key](#adding-a-foreign-key) for how to properly add foreign keys.

```ruby
class CreateUserProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :user_projects do |t|
      t.belongs_to :user, foreign_key: true
      t.belongs_to :project, foreign_key: false
    end
  end
end

class AddForeignKeyFromUserProjectsToProject < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_foreign_key :user_projects, :projects
  end
end
```

### Removing a table with multiple foreign keys

:x: **Bad**

Removing a table with multiple foreign keys blocks reads and writes on all involved tables until migration is completed.
Remove all the foreign keys first.

Assuming, `projects` has foreign keys on `users.id` and `repositories.id`:

```ruby
class DropProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    drop_table :projects
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Remove all the foreign keys first:

```ruby
class RemoveProjectsUserFk < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    remove_foreign_key :projects, :users
  end
end

class RemoveProjectsRepositoryFk < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    remove_foreign_key :projects, :repositories
  end
end
```

Then remove the table:

```ruby
class DropProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    drop_table :projects
  end
end
```

### Mismatched reference column types

:x: **Bad**

Reference columns should be of the same type as the referenced primary key.
Otherwise, there's a risk of bugs caused by IDs representable by one type but not the other.

Assuming, there is a `users` table with `bigint` primary key type:

```ruby
class AddUserIdToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :projects, :user_id, :integer
  end
end
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Add a reference column of the same type as a referenced primary key.

Assuming, there is a `users` table with `bigint` primary key type:

```ruby
class AddUserIdToProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :projects, :user_id, :bigint
  end
end
```

### Adding a single table inheritance column

:x: **Bad**

Adding a single table inheritance column might cause errors in old instances of your application.

```ruby
class AddTypeToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :string, :type, default: "Member"
  end
end
```

After the migration was ran and the column was added, but before the code is fully deployed to all instances, an old instance may be restarted (due to an error etc). And when it will fetch 'User' records from the database, 'User' will look for a 'Member' subclass (from the 'type' column) and fail to locate it unless it is already defined.

:white_check_mark: **Good**

A safer approach is to:

1. ignore the column:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     self.ignored_columns += ["type"]
   end
   ```

2. deploy
3. remove the column ignoring from step 1 and apply initial code changes
4. deploy

### Changing the default value of a column

:x: **Bad**

Active Record < 7 enables partial writes by default, which can cause incorrect values to be inserted when changing the default value of a column.

```ruby
class ChangeSomeColumnDefault < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    change_column_default :users, :some_column, from: "old", to: "new"
  end
end

User.create!(some_column: "old") # can insert "new"
```

:white_check_mark: **Good**

Disable partial writes in `config/application.rb`. For Active Record < 7, use:

```ruby
config.active_record.partial_writes = false
```

For Active Record 7, use:

```ruby
config.active_record.partial_inserts = false
```

## Assuring Safety

To mark a step in the migration as safe, despite using a method that might otherwise be dangerous, wrap it in a `safety_assured` block.

```ruby
class MySafeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    safety_assured { remove_column :users, :some_column }
  end
end
```

Certain methods like `execute` and `change_table` cannot be inspected and are prevented from running by default. Make sure what you're doing is really safe and use this pattern.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Run `createdb online_migrations_test` to create a test database. Then, run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. This project uses multiple Gemfiles to test against multiple versions of Active Record; you can run the tests against the specific version with `BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/activerecord_61.gemfile bundle exec rake test`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Background migrations:

- extract as a separate gem
- add UI
- support batching over non-integer and multiple columns

## Comparison to `strong_migrations`

This gem was heavily inspired by the `strong_migrations` and GitLab's approaches to database migrations. This gem is a superset of `strong_migrations`, feature-wise, and has the same APIs.

The main differences are:

1. `strong_migrations` provides you **text guidance** on how to run migrations safer and you should implement them yourself. This new gem has actual [**code helpers**](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/blob/master/lib/online_migrations/schema_statements.rb) (and suggests them when fails on unsafe migrations) you can use to do what you want. See [example](#example) for an example.

   It has migrations helpers for:

     * renaming tables/columns
     * changing columns types (including changing primary/foreign keys from `integer` to `bigint`)
     * adding columns with default values
     * backfilling data
     * adding different types of constraints
     * and others

2. This gem has a powerful internal framework for running [data migrations](docs/background_data_migrations.md) and [schema migrations](docs/background_schema_migrations.md) on very large tables in background.

   For example, you can use background migrations to migrate data that’s stored in a single JSON column to a separate table instead; backfill values from one column to another (as one of the steps when changing column type); or backfill some column’s value from an API.

3. Yet, it has more checks for unsafe changes (see [checks](#checks)).

4. Currently, this gem supports only PostgreSQL, while `strong_migrations` also checks `MySQL` and `MariaDB` migrations.

5. This gem is more flexible in terms of configuration - see [config file](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/blob/master/lib/online_migrations/config.rb) for additional configuration options.
