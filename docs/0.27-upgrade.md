# Upgrading to online_migrations 0.27.0

In this version, background data migrations internals were significantly refactored and rewritten, that allowed to make the gem much simpler and its API more flexible and not attached to a single use case (whole table data migrations). It relies on [Sidekiq's Iteration feature](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Iteration), so having Sidekiq 7.3.3+ is a hard requirement for background data migrations feature to work now.

This is one of the preceding releases before v1.0.

To upgrade:

* Upgrade gem to v0.27: `gem 'online_migrations', '~> 0.27.0'`
* Upgrade the gem's initializer in `config/online_migrations.rb` by referring to the [newest contents](https://github.com/fatkodima/online_migrations/blob/master/lib/generators/online_migrations/templates/initializer.rb.tt)

If you don't use any of the [background data migrations](background_data_migrations.md) or [background schema migrations](background_schema_migrations.md), then this is probably all you need.

If you use background data migrations:

* Make sure all existing background data migrations completed before upgrading

* Get the latest schema changes
  ```sh
  $ bin/rails generate online_migrations:upgrade
  $ bin/rails db:migrate
  ```

Look at [background data migrations guide](background_data_migrations.md) to find the API changes and new features.
